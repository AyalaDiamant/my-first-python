# Python library management system

This Python project is a simple library management system that allows users to perform basic library operations such as borrowing books, returning books, and generating receipts for borrowed items.

## Properties:
- Borrowing books: users can borrow books from the library by providing the book details.
- Returning books: users can return borrowed books to the library.
- Generating receipts: at the end of a user's session, a receipt is created containing today's date and the list of books borrowed by the user.

## Usage:
Run the script `library_management.py` to start the library management system.
Follow the on-screen instructions to borrow or return books.
At the end of your session, a receipt will be printed with your transaction details.
